\section{General Variable Neighborhood search}
\label{sec:general_vns}

TODO: wrong algorithm, we are implementing general VNS, see slide 11.

In this programming exercise, we build on our local search from the
previous exercise and implement a variable neighborhood search
heuristic.

%%% brauchen wir sowas?
\begin{algorithm}[caption={Variable Neighborhood Search}]
    input: Graph 
    output: Improved solution
    begin
        l (*$\leftarrow$*) 1;
	repeat:
    	find (*$x'$*) with (*$f(x') \leq f(x''), \forall x'' \in N_l(x) $*) calculate initial solution
        if (*f($x') < f(x)$*) then
           (*$x \leftarrow x'$*);
           l (*$\leftarrow$*) 1;
        else 
           l (*$\leftarrow$*) l + 1
	until  (*$l > l_{max}$*)
    end
\end{algorithm}

%%% NEIGHBORHOODS HERE
\subsection{Neighborhoods}
\label{neighborhoods}
We re-use the neighborhoods from assignment two and added a parameterized node move variant:

\begin{description}
\item[X-node-move] 
Defined as all subsets where X vertices of the initial solution are moved to other positions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Size of neigborhood: $(n-1)^2 * X $
\item Objective Function: Incremental, only crossings for moved edges are recalculated.
\end{itemize}

\end{description}
 
The neighborhoods from last assignement:

\begin{description}
\item[1-node flip] 
    
    This neighborhood is defined as all subsets where two vertices of the initial solution are flipped.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Size of neigborhood: $n(n-1)/2$
        \item Objective Function: Incremental, crossings from flipped vertices are subtracted and recalculated.

    \end{itemize}

	
\item[1-edge move] This neighborhood consists of all solutions where one edge is moved to a different page. 
     \begin{itemize}
        \item Size of neigborhood: $(pages-1) edges$ 
        \item Objective Function: Incremental, only crossings for moved edges are recalculated.
    \end{itemize}
   
	
\item[1-node edge move] This neighborhood consists of all solutions where the edges of
	one vertex on a specific page are moved to all different pages. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Size of neigborhood: $(pages-1) edges$ as worst case.\footnote{depending on number of edges on respective node pages}
        \item Objective Function: Incremental, only crossings for moved edges are recalculated.
    \end{itemize}
    

\end{description}



\subsection{Neigborhoodstructures in General VNS}

As shown in the algorithm in section \ref{sec:general_vns} we define two non-overlapping sets of neigborhoods:

\begin{description}

    \item{VNS}: used for the shaking, we decided to take the complex neighborhoods here, which dannot be completly searched.
                
                1-node-move, 2-node-move, 3-node-move
                
    \item{VND}: used for variable neighborhood descent in the inner loop:
         
                1-edge-move, 1-node-edge-move

\end{description}

\section{Results}

We executed the code on a desktop computer with a Core i7 Quad-Core
CPU with 2.67Ghz and 24 GB of main memory. Table~\ref{tab:results}
shows the results of our local search. 

We have set a timout of 5 minutes for the calculations.


% there are no stepfunctions
%\paragraph{Best neighborhood step function strategy}


%Overall, the combination of the 1-node-flip neighborhood and the best
%step-function shows the best improvements. For example, it finds a
%solution with only $12$ edge-crossings for the instance automatic-4.
%Not surprisingly, it also has the highest run-time.




\paragraph{Order of the neighborhoods}

TODO: I would guess it does matter... we probably should run some experiments...

see experiments in assignment3\_stats.sh

\caption{Local search results. For each instance, we show the number
  of crossings (first row), the iteration needed to reach the local
  optimum (second row, first value) and the run-time in seconds of our
  algorithm (second row, second value).  If no local optimum was found
  the number of iterations is -1. The best solution is highlighted in
  bold.}
