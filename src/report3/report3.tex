\section{General Variable Neighborhood search}
\label{sec:general_vns}

In this programming exercise, we implement a  generalized variable neighborhood
search heuristic, reusing the neighborhoods from our previous exercise.
The algorithm is implemented as shown in the following listing:

TODO: algo


%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
%%% NEIGHBORHOODS HERE
\subsection{Neighborhoods}
\label{neighborhoods}
We re-use the neighborhoods from assignment two and add a parameterized node move variant:

\begin{description}
\item[X-node-move] 
Defined as all subsets where X vertices of the initial solution are moved to other positions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Size of neigborhood: $(n-1)^2 * X $
\item Objective Function: Incremental, only crossings for moved edges are recalculated.
\end{itemize}

\end{description}
 
The neighborhoods from last assignement:

\begin{description}
\item[1-node flip] 
    
    This neighborhood is defined as all subsets where two vertices of the initial solution are flipped.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Size of neigborhood: $n(n-1)/2$
        \item Objective Function: Incremental, crossings from flipped vertices are subtracted and recalculated.

    \end{itemize}

	
\item[1-edge move] This neighborhood consists of all solutions where one edge is moved to a different page. 
     \begin{itemize}
        \item Size of neigborhood: $(pages-1) edges$ 
        \item Objective Function: Incremental, only crossings for moved edges are recalculated.
    \end{itemize}
   
	
\item[1-node edge move] This neighborhood consists of all solutions where the edges of
	one vertex on a specific page are moved to all different pages. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Size of neigborhood: $(pages-1) edges$ as worst case.\footnote{depending on number of edges on respective node pages}
        \item Objective Function: Incremental, only crossings for moved edges are recalculated.
    \end{itemize}
    

\end{description}



\subsection{Neigborhoodstructures in General VNS}
\label{neighborhood_orders}

As shown in the algorithm in section \ref{sec:general_vns} we define two non-overlapping sets of neigborhoods:

\begin{description}

    \item{VNS}: used for the shaking, we decided to take the complex neighborhoods here, which dannot be completly searched.
                We use the following order:
                
                1-node-move, 2-node-move, 3-node-move
                
    \item{VND}: used for variable neighborhood descent in the inner loop in the following order:
         
                1-edge-move, 1-node-edge-move

\end{description}

\section{Results}

We executed the code on a desktop computer with a Core i7 Quad-Core
CPU with 2.67Ghz and 24 GB of main memory. 

\paragraph{}
We have set a timout of 5 minutes for the calculations.
Because we are relying on random calculations, all measurements are given as 
statistic evaluation over 30 runs.


\paragraph{}
Table~\ref{tab:resultsOverall} shows the number of crossings
for the GVNS using the order of neighborhoods as described in section \ref{neighborhood_orders}, 
table  \ref{tab:Timing} shows the respective timings.

We find that for the small instances the GVNS finds better
solutions than the local search we used in the previous
exercise. The timing in Table~\ref{tab:Timing} shows that for
larger instances (except instance 7) the maximum run-time is usually exhausted and, as a
result, we do not find large improvements compared to the local search
in the previous exercise.


%
%
%\paragraph{Order of the neighborhoods}
%Tables~\ref{tab:resultsDeterministic} and \ref{tab:resultsStochastic}
%show the results when we change the order of our neighborhoods. In
%Table~/ref{tab:resultsDeterminstic} we report the results where we
%keep the order of the stochastic neighborhoods used for shaking the
%same and invert the order of the other
%neighborhoods. Table~\ref{tab:resultsStochastic} shows the results
%where we flip the order of the neighborhoods used for shaking and keep
%the others the same. As expected, changing the order of our
%neighborhoods does influence the results of the GVNS.

\paragraph{Order of the neighborhoods}

We make two addittional experiments where we change the order of neighborhoods as defined
in section \ref{neighborhood_orders}.

  \scriptsize
  \input{timeTab-stoch-order}
\caption{Runtime in seconds using reverse order of VNS neighborhood}
\label{tab:TimingVns}
\end{table}



Tables~\ref{tab:resultsVns} and ~\ref{tab:TimingVns} show the respective results when we reverse
the order of the VNS neighborhoods used for the shaking.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \scriptsize
  \input{crossingsTab-det}
\caption{Number of crossings using reverse order of VND neighborhood}
\label{tab:resultsVnd}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \scriptsize
  \input{timeTab-det-order}
\caption{Runtime in seconds using reverse order of VND neighborhood}
\label{tab:TimingVnd}
\end{table}

Tables~\ref{tab:resultsVnd} and ~\ref{tab:TimingVnd} show the respective results when we reverse
the order of the VND neighborhoods used for neighborhood descent.



As we can see, the reverse order of the VNS neighborhoods improves the minimum number of crossings. If we are looking
at the timing results of instance 7 in table \ref{tab:TimingVns}, we see that the variance in the runtime is significantly
higher than in the original order. This means that we get a better minimum for the cost of stability of the solution,
originating in the fact that we start exchaning 3 random vertices, than just 1 as in the original order.
